# Andiora Driver Center

A focused GTK4/libadwaita application for inspecting, installing, and repairing
hardware drivers. It replaces the only broadly useful part of
`software-properties-gtk` without inheriting Ubuntu's repository, update,
authentication, and release-upgrade user interfaces.

The audio page reports the installed Intel SOF firmware and ALSA UCM packages,
deployed support files, loaded SOF modules, and active PCI audio drivers.
Missing Andiora audio support packages can be installed through the same
restricted polkit helper used for other driver operations.

The printing page reports CUPS service and startup health, configured and
paused queues, the default destination, and package versions grouped by their
roles in core printing, driverless IPP, network discovery, and optional
compatibility. Missing optional legacy or scanning packages are informational
rather than failures on a healthy driverless setup.

When components are missing, a single polkit-backed action installs a fixed
printing package allowlist. The printing availability switch can mask every
CUPS activation path, network discovery, and the static USB IPP service to
reduce attack surface without uninstalling packages; enabling it reverses the
masks and starts the normal printing units.

The unprivileged UI reads hardware state. Mutating operations go through a
fixed polkit helper which only accepts drivers reported by `ubuntu-drivers`,
the Andiora xpadneo package, and fixed audio and printing operations.

Secure Boot, MOK enrollment, DKMS signing health, repair operations, and the
trust panel are provided by `andiora-secureboot-toolkit`. This is the same
implementation and fixed enrollment-code experience used by Andiora OOBE;
Driver Center must not add a second Secure Boot backend or diverging prompts.
